# CMSC 203

These labs cover methods of object-oriented program development and design based on **Java** programming language. The course also covers language systems and semantics, structured program verification, different language paradigms, 
and documentation techniques. I used a structured, high-level object-oriented programming language and learn to use both text-oriented and Windows-based user interfaces. 
Designing and implementing solutions to intermediate-level programming assignments are an integral part of the course.

## Take-Aways
Upon completing this course, I had learned to:
- Describe the object-oriented programming environment and features
- Describe the concepts of object-oriented programming, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, and recursion
- Design, develop, modify, test, debug, and run JAVA applications/applets utilizing the object-oriented programming features of JAVA language
- Design and implement both text-oriented and windows-based user interfaces with Event-Driven Input and Output
- Design and implement intermediate-level programming assignments that include file input and file output processing
